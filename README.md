Exercises in need of aid:
  - I need to build a simple app for paint_calculator
  - The last challenge on the pizza_party is a small doozy. Should make efforts to work that out when you can.
  - legal_driving_age: Instead of hard-coding the driving age in your program logic, research driving ages for various countries and create a lookup table for the driving ages and countries. Prompt for the age, and display which countries the user can legally drive in.
